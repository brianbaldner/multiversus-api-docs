# Multiversus API Documentation
Community maintained documentation on the in-game Multiversus API. This is very early and we do not know everything yet.

## Auth:
Getting authentication is the most confusing part of the api. It is unclear how to use every platform to log in, and unless you use Fiddler, you have to use your Steam credentials to log in ( I recommend linking a Steam account to your profile if you havenâ€™t). More info can be found [here](/auth/README.md).

## Contributing:
Use [template.md](template.md) to create the documentation for each endpoint. Make sure to put response.json in the same folder as each doc with the server response. The path should be `/root/path/doc.md`
